# DiabetesPatientCare

In this project, we aim to see how demographic data for patients, such as race, gender, age, and weight are related to hospital procedures and outcomes for a patient when they are dealing with diabetes. Outcomes and procedures can be defined as the number of lab tests, procedures, medication, diagnosis, type of prescribed drug, and patient readmission. We know that the healthcare field can suffer from bias in administering treatment to minorities and women. By going through our data, we can assess what kinds of procedures and treatments are administered to patients of all demographics, and how this might affect their outcomes. For instance, are certain drugs prescribed more often to certain demographics? Are other drugs more suited to better outcomes? Are certain demographics more readmitted than others? The results of our model can be used as a guiding tool for healthcare providers in determining where the current operating procedure may be failing certain patients, and provide a way for healthcare providers to be mindful of such an issue, and put more resources towards the wellbeing of their patients.
